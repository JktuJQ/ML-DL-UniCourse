# Research on ensemble methods

This folder contains my work on **ensemble methods**.

## Decision Tree from scratch

I would build ensemble methods upon decision trees,
I have decided to just build it myself!

You can see that implementation in this [file](decision_tree.ipynb);
results are visualized.

My implementation also includes several stop conditions and
support for random feature selection.
All of that would come in handy when I will use those trees in ensemble methods.
