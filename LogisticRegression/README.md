# Research on Logistic Regression model

This folder contains my work on **Logistic Regression** model.

## Logistic Regression from scratch

To fully understand anything, you just have to build it yourself!

Fortunately, Logistic Regression model is fairly simple -
it is just a linear regression model whose results are clamped into $ [0, 1] $ range
by sigmoid function.

You can see that implementation in this [file](model_from_scratch.ipynb);
results are visualized.
