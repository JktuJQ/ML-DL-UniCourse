# ML/DL Uni Course

This repository contains all of my seminars and homework assignments,
completed during my university course on ML/DL.

They are usually stored in Jupiter Notebook format because it's very convenient, but
some assignments are saved as multiple Python files,
and fairly large projects are stored in separate repositories, links to which are going to be provided.

While most of the text and code is my own,
I still owe a debt of gratitude to my [teacher](https://github.com/ShadarRim)
for developing the [course](https://github.com/ShadarRim/25AIMEPhI) as a whole.
